#FR-01: Device Onboarding
Description: System shall provision and register IoT devices (drones/sensors) securely using a unified API.
Rationale: Enables automated enrollment to scale deployments without manual intervention, addressing vendor lock-in via cross-platform compatibility.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Device ID, credentials; Output: Registration token, endpoint config.
Acceptance Criteria: Device connects successfully within 30s; verified via API response 200 OK and log entry.

#FR-02: Secure Communications
Description: System shall enforce mTLS for all device-to-cloud interactions over MQTT/HTTP.
Rationale: Protects against eavesdropping and ensures data integrity in sensitive drone detection scenarios.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Encrypted payload; Output: Acknowledgment receipt.
Acceptance Criteria: All sessions use TLS 1.3+; fail unencrypted attempts with error code.

#FR-03: Data Ingestion
Description: System shall ingest telemetry (audio streams/events) via gateways with backpressure handling.
Rationale: Handles bursty data from multiple devices efficiently in serverless setup.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: JSON/audio payload; Output: Ingestion ID.
Acceptance Criteria: Processes 100 events/sec without loss; confirmed by queue metrics.

#FR-04: Data Validation
Description: System shall validate incoming data against schema and QoS rules.
Rationale: Ensures data quality for accurate sound analytics and drone classification.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Raw telemetry; Output: Validated data or DLQ routing.
Acceptance Criteria: 99% valid data pass; invalid routed to DLQ with alert.

#FR-05: Data Storage
Description: System shall store validated data in hot/cold paths with idempotency.
Rationale: Supports querying and long-term retention for research/analysis.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Validated payload; Output: Storage reference.
Acceptance Criteria: Data retrievable within 1s (hot), 10s (cold); duplicate handling verified.

#FR-06: Analytics and Alerts
Description: System shall perform ML-based sound analytics (e.g., CNN for drone detection) and trigger alerts.
Rationale: Enables real-time anomaly detection in IoT streams.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Stored/stream data; Output: Alert notification (SMS/email/webhook).
Acceptance Criteria: Detection accuracy >95%; alert latency <500ms.

#FR-07: Dashboards and APIs
Description: System shall provide unified API and dashboards for querying data and visualizations.
Rationale: Facilitates researcher/operator access across clouds.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Query parameters; Output: JSON results/dashboard view.
Acceptance Criteria: API response <200ms; dashboard loads in <3s.

#FR-08: Data Lifecycle Management
Description: System shall enforce retention policies and data purging.
Rationale: Complies with GDPR and optimizes storage costs.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Policy config; Output: Purge confirmation.
Acceptance Criteria: Data deleted after 30 days; audited via logs.

#FR-09: Admin and RBAC
Description: System shall manage user roles and policies via unified API.
Rationale: Ensures secure access control for admins/operators/researchers.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Role assignment; Output: Access token.
Acceptance Criteria: Unauthorized access denied; audited.

#FR-10: Failure Handling
Description: System shall route failures to DLQs and retry idempotent operations.
Rationale: Maintains reliability in distributed IoT environments.
Inputs/Outputs: Input: Failed event; Output: Retry or alert.
Acceptance Criteria: 99% recovery rate; no data loss.
