# Overview
Research on serverless cloud architectures for sound analytics and drone detection in IoT contexts has grown, driven by the need for scalable, low-latency processing of acoustic data from edge devices. Serverless computing, often implemented via Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), enables event-driven execution where functions are triggered by IoT sensor data (e.g., audio streams from microphones on drones or ground sensors), scaling automatically without infrastructure management. However, direct integrations of serverless with acoustic drone detection remain emerging, with most studies focusing on related areas: serverless in IoT for edge analytics, acoustic-based drone detection using ML/IoT, and general serverless challenges.
Key research themes include:

Serverless in IoT for Analytics: Studies explore edge-fog-cloud hierarchies to process IoT data, reducing latency for real-time applications like audio analysis.
Sound Analytics for Drone Detection: Acoustic sensors capture drone propeller noise, processed via ML models (e.g., CNN, RNN) for detection and classification, often integrated with IoT networks.
Architecture Features: Common features emphasize scalability, cost-efficiency, and integration with IoT/edge computing, but face portability hurdles.
